# AssemblerSimulator
Assembler simulator written in C

To compile: type 'make'

To run:
  1. One test file: './assembler tests/test1'
  2. Several test files: './assembler tests/test1 tests/test2 tests/test3'
  
Then the required 'ent', 'ext' and 'ob' files with the test name will be created under /tests.
For exmaple: test1.ent, test1.ext, test1.ob will be created when we run './assembler tests/test1'
